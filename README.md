# Machine Learning Decision Support System for Acute Myeloid Leukemia

This study presents a decision support system that automatically recommends appropriate oncology therapy protocol for a given AML patient based on the survival/decease prediction.
The system proposed in this work combines prediction models computed by three established machine learning methods: Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression. 
The purpose of this system is to automatically recommend the best set of treatments for patients with AML based on the automatic prediction of clinical outcome (survival/decease).
The datasets used to train and evaluate the prediction models that compose our support decision system come from studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) and Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). 
These datasets comprise clinical and genetic data of patients with AML. Both are real and available in the public domain at https://www.cbioportal.org/. We used three sets with data collected from the same patients: one with clinical information, one with gene mutation data, and one with gene expression data.

In this repository, the processed databases used in our study are available.
